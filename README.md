# Estimating Empirical Asset Pricing Models using Regression Methods (Six-Factor based on Fama French and Momentum)
In this project, I and my group perform a statistical analysis on the returns of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA). 

This analysis consists of the implementation of three linear models of the stock return against a  multifactor model:
- Multiple linear regression
- Ridge regression
- Lasso

In this project we also apply our data curation skills.
