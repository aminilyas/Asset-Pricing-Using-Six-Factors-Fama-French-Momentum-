In this project, I and my group perform a statistical analysis on the returns of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA). 

This analysis consists of the implementation of three linear models of the stock return against a  multifactor model:
- Multiple linear regression
- Ridge regression
- Lasso

In this project we also practie our data curation skills.
